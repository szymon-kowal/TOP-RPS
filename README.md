## Overview

Languages used : HTML, CSS, JS

This project involves creating a Rock Paper Scissors game that can be played in the console. The game allows the user to play against the computer in a 5-round match, keeping score and reporting the winner or loser at the end.

## Development Steps

1. **Set Up Git Repository:**
   - Start a new Git repository for the Rock Paper Scissors game.
   - Commit early and often with descriptive commit messages.

2. **HTML Document:**
   - Create a blank HTML document with a script tag linking to an external JavaScript file.
   - The game will be played entirely in the console.

3. **Get Computer Choice:**
   - Implement a function called `getComputerChoice` that randomly returns 'Rock', 'Paper', or 'Scissors'.

4. **Play Single Round:**
   - Write a function called `playRound` that takes two parameters: `playerSelection` and `computerSelection`.
   - Make `playerSelection` case-insensitive.
   - Return a string declaring the winner of the round.

5. **Game Function:**
   - Create a new function called `game`.
   - Use the `playRound` function to play a 5-round game with scorekeeping.
   - Display the results of each round and announce the winner or loser at the end.

## Getting Started

To play the Rock Paper Scissors game, open the HTML document in your preferred web browser's console. Follow the prompts and see the results after each round.

Happy coding!
